# Chemical-Compound-Tkinter-App
This project deals with calling the PubChem's Rest API and displaying basic information about a chemical compound the user is interested in on a desktop tkinter application. The user searches for a chemical compound, a call to the REST API is made, and the chemical compound's name, molecular formula, molecular weight, and image of its structure is displayed.

# How to Run
